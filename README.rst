PyEditor
==================================================

Python Editor for beginners and Minecraft Fans


Quickstart
----------

Clone the repo::

    $ git clone git@github.com:PyEditor/PyEditor.git
    $ cd PyEditor

Run the tests with the default Python version:

Create virtual environment (see also below)::

    $ mkvirtualenv -a "$(pwd)" PyEditor

Then run the tests::

    $ py.test -v tests

or::

    $ make test

Run the tests via tox for all Python versions configured in ``tox.ini``:

Install tox::

    $ pip install --user tox

Then run::

    $ tox


Code QA
-------

The included Makefile is set up to run several Python static code
checking and reporting tools. To print a list of available Makefile
targets and the tools they run, simple run::

    $ make

Then run the Makefile target of your choice, e.g.::

    $ make flake8

Using a virtual environment
---------------------------

Unless noted otherwise, all Makefile targets run all tools directly, i.e.
without tox, which means they need to be installed in your Python
environment, preferably in a project-specific virtual environment. To
create a virtual environment and install all supported tools and their
dependencies run::

    $ mkvirtualenv -a "$(pwd)" PyEditor
    (PyEditor)$ pip install -r requirements/dev.txt


Documentation
-------------

Package documentation is generated by Sphinx. The documentation can be
build with::

    $ make docs

After a successful build the documentation index is opened in your web
browser.
